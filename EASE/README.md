# EASE (Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoders for Sparse Data)

This folder contains the implementation of the EASE method, as described in 
[this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3308558.3313710). EASE is a simple, efficient method that delivers 
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for predicting the k-th next user-item interaction using an implicit interaction matrix.

> Note: While EASE is excellent for ranking items by their likelihood of interaction, the predicted scores do not directly 
> correlate to actual user ratings.
