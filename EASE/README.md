# EASE (Embarrassingly Shallow Autoencoders for Sparse Data)

This folder contains the implementation of the EASE method, as proposed in 
[this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3308558.3313710). EASE is an efficient and easy-to-implement method that 
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

To enhance computational speed, we have implemented this method using the PyTorch library, as time is a critical factor 
in our project.
